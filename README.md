# Let's Hear

Letâ€™s Hear is an online tool that seeks to empower users of induction loop technology by letting them map the provision of public hearing loops across the world.

Built in NextJS, you'll need a database to connect the frontend to. Auth is handled by Firebase.


You'll need environment variables for Firebase and Mapbox as well.

**Mapbox**
```

```
